    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1/4 cup finely chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinammon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup almond milk</li>
        <li>2 small overripe bananas, mashed</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, walnuts, sugar, baking powder, nutmeg, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl; make a well in the center.</li>
    
        <li>Whisk almond milk, bananas, melted butter, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until smooth. Whisk in egg. Pour mixture into the well in the flour mixture; stir until just combined.</li>
    
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled skillet over medium-high heat. Drop 1/4 cup batter into the skillet; tilt gently to spread batter evenly. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are firm, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
