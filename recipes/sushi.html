    <h2>How to Make Sushi</h2>

    <p>
    Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice,
    usually with some sugar and salt, accompanied by a variety of
    ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles
    of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key
    ingredient is <strong>"sushi rice",</strong> also referred to as shari, or
    sumeshi.

    <h3>Preparation</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Cut straight down through the salmon filet, then cut
            that piece in half through the center so you have a
            small strip.</li>

        <li>Place your desired ingredients sliced onto the rice, with
            a bed of seaweed below it.</li>

        <li>Roll it up tightly, using a bamboo mat. If you don't have
            one, you can sort of use parchment paper or plastic wrap.</li>

        <li>Finally, use a sharp knife to cut the sushi roll into pieces.</li>
    </ol>
